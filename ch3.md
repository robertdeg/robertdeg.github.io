# Boolean Algebra

In 1847, George Boole proposed a mathematics for zeroes and ones, called Boolean Algebra.
This algebra defines how to add and multiply with the number 0 and 1.
As a result, the logic building blocks of Chapter 2 can be described mathematically.

In Boolean Algebra, addition (performed by the '+' operator) corresponds to a logic OR.
Multiplication on the other hand, corresponds to a logic AND.
This means that the rules for addition and multiplication are as follows:
